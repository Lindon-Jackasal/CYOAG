    <h1><u>About the Game</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size: 19px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;">
        My game is based on the story, “Humpty Dumpty” but with a variety of conditions. 
        What if Humpty Dumpty did not climbed up and sat on the wall? What if instead he had 
        listened to the advice of the people and discontinued his skipping and jumping around? 
        My game will allow the user to assume the role of Humpty Dumpty and choose from a variety 
        of choices in order to determine the outcome of the game. The storyline of the game was not 
        directly taken from any story book instead the original storyline of Humpty Dumpty (Anonymous) 
        was taken and modified to suite the “choose your own adventure game”.
